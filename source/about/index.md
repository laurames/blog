Hi, I'm a Helsinki based engineer-artist who's passion is to not separated an engineer from a designer. The world wants professional who know left and right. Art and Science. Ones who make things that "do" cool and look cool!

Currently I work as a front-end developer in Canter creating web apps and graphic designs. On my free time I make videos, do photographing and design printed products. I have a huge passion towards learning new things and trying out latest technologies. I believe that places me strongly capable of solving current problems in the industry. I bring dedication and hard work with an aptitude for details.

I believe that my educational background, design knowledge and passion for learning new things is the way forward in the field of front-end development and media production. That's why i believe I'm the engineer-artist, knowing the two sides of the coin, a true EngineerArtist!
