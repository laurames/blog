### Our Project: Perfect Person (group 4)

{% asset_img Collage_firstWeek3.jpg Collage of our project for the exhibition  %}

When the team got together for the first time we had no idea of what to do. Then ideas started popping up from Plato all the way to defining the definition of error. In the end we wanted to focus on the very clear scientific meaning of an error where it can be clearly said to be one in terms of comparing to a perfect model. We defined it as:

> An error is a deviation from a standard, specification or model. It is a calculable, observable or otherwise difference from what is defined as being perfection.

This definition goes back very strongly to Plato's idea of "Theory of Forms" that states forms to be "archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason" [wikipedia - Theory of Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato#Theory_of_Forms).

With this starting point we took the human form as a starting point and wanted to express the "errors" we observe in ourselves. To make the art work interactive we allowed anyone anonymously the freedom to speak their flaws/errors out into a sound cloud and place a sticker where they perceive the error to be.

The team split up to collect materials for the project and the hunt for a mannequin began. In the end we found a perfect one from tori.fi that was a white, tall, slim, ripped, male. This fit perfectly as an "perfect person" as in todays society perfection is to be all of that. Now all we needed was input from the visitors to cover our perfect person with imperfections!

# Others Projects

All together there was 10 teams all with unique ways of looking at error. There where tons of ideas and some of there where: cultural errors, scientific error, optical illusions, mutations, curated error, evolution, miscommunication, technical errors, behavioural errors, subjective behaviour, subjective idea of error (is it possible to actually have an error), etc.
